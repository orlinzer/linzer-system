# Interface

## Process Interface

- **Environment Variables**: The process interface allows you to set environment variables that will be available to the process. This is useful for configuring the behavior of the process without modifying the code.
- **Configuration Files**: The process interface allows you to specify configuration files that will be used by the process. This is useful for configuring the behavior of the process without modifying the code.
- **Command Line Arguments**: The process interface allows you to pass command line arguments to the process. This is useful for configuring the behavior of the process without modifying the code.
- **Standard Input/Output**: The process interface allows you to read from and write to standard input and output. This is useful for interacting with the process in a more flexible way.
- **Exit Codes**: The process interface allows you to specify exit codes for the process. This is useful for indicating the success or failure of the process.
- **Signal Handling**: The process interface allows you to handle signals sent to the process. This is useful for gracefully shutting down the process or handling other events.
- **Networking**: The process interface allows you to specify network settings for the process. This is useful for configuring the behavior of the process in a networked environment.
- **File I/O**: The process interface allows you to read from and write to files. This is useful for interacting with the process in a more flexible way.
- **Logging**: The process interface allows you to log messages from the process. This is useful for debugging and monitoring the process.
- **Tracing**: The process interface allows you to trace the execution of the process. This is useful for debugging and performance analysis.
- **Metrics**: The process interface allows you to collect metrics from the process. This is useful for monitoring the performance of the process.
- **Debugging**: The process interface allows you to debug the process. This is useful for finding and fixing bugs in the process.
- **Testing**: The process interface allows you to test the process. This is useful for ensuring that the process behaves as expected.

## System Interface
