# Goals

This document outlines the goals of the linzer-system project.

1. **Trustless Distributed Information System**: The project aims to create a trustless distributed system that allows for secure and reliable data transport. This means that the system should be able to operate without the need for a central authority or trusted intermediary, ensuring that data can be transferred securely and efficiently.
   1. **Trustless**: The system should be able to operate without the need for a central authority or trusted intermediary. This means that the system should be able to verify the integrity and authenticity of data without relying on a single point of trust.
   2. **Distributed**: The system should be able to operate across multiple nodes or locations, allowing for greater scalability and redundancy. This means that the system should be able to handle large volumes of data and traffic without becoming a bottleneck.
   3. **Information**: The system should be able to handle a wide variety of data types and formats, allowing for greater flexibility and interoperability. This means that the system should be able to work with different data sources and formats, including structured and unstructured data.
      1. **Data Transport**: The primary goal of the project is to transport data from one place to another. This includes transferring data between different systems, databases, or applications.
      2. **Data Storage**: The project will provide options for storing data in various formats and locations. This includes support for different databases, file formats, and cloud storage solutions.
      3. **Data Validation**: The project will include mechanisms to validate the data being transported. This ensures that the data meets certain quality standards and is suitable for use in the target system.
      4. **Data Transformation**: The project aims to transform data into a format that is suitable for the target system. This may involve converting data types, changing data structures, or applying business rules to the data.
   4. **System**: The project will provide a complete system for managing data transport, including tools for monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting. This means that the system should be able to provide visibility into the data transport process and allow for easy debugging and error handling.
      1. **Monitoring**: The project will include tools for monitoring the data transport process. This includes tracking the status of data transfers, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring that data is being transported as expected.
      2. **Logging**: The project will include logging capabilities to capture information about the data transport process. This includes recording errors, warnings, and other important events that occur during data transfers.
      3. **Troubleshooting**: The project will provide tools for troubleshooting issues that arise during data transport. This includes identifying the root cause of problems, providing recommendations for resolution, and allowing for easy debugging of the system.
      4. **User Interface**: The project will include a user interface for managing and monitoring the data transport process. This includes providing a dashboard for viewing the status of data transfers, as well as tools for configuring and managing the system.
      5. **Documentation**: The project will include comprehensive documentation to help users understand how to use the system. This includes user guides, API documentation, and troubleshooting guides.
      6. **Support**: The project will provide support for users who encounter issues or have questions about the system. This includes providing a help desk, community forums, and other resources to assist users in using the system effectively.
      7. **Security**: The project will include security features to protect data during transport. This includes encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify data.
      8. **Scalability**: The project will be designed to scale easily to accommodate growing data volumes and user demands. This includes support for distributed architectures, load balancing, and other techniques to ensure that the system can handle increased traffic and data loads.
      9. **Interoperability**: The project will be designed to work with a wide variety of systems and technologies. This includes support for different programming languages, platforms, and protocols to ensure that the system can integrate with existing systems and workflows.
      10. **Extensibility**: The project will be designed to allow for easy customization and extension. This includes providing APIs, plugins, and other mechanisms to allow users to add new features or integrate with other systems.
      11. **Performance**: The project will be designed to provide high performance and low latency for data transport. This includes optimizing data transfer speeds, minimizing resource usage, and ensuring that the system can handle large volumes of data efficiently.
      12. **Reliability**: The project will be designed to provide high reliability and availability for data transport. This includes implementing redundancy, failover mechanisms, and other techniques to ensure that the system can continue to operate even in the event of failures or outages.
      13. **Usability**: The project will be designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. This includes providing intuitive interfaces, clear documentation, and helpful error messages to assist users in using the system effectively.
      14. **Maintainability**: The project will be designed to be easy to maintain and update. This includes providing clear code structure, documentation, and testing to ensure that the system can be easily modified and improved over time.
      15. **Community**: The project will be designed to foster a strong community of users and developers. This includes providing forums, mailing lists, and other resources to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among users and contributors.
      16. **Open Source**: The project will be open source, allowing users to view, modify, and contribute to the codebase. This includes providing a public repository, issue tracker, and other resources to facilitate collaboration and contributions from the community.
